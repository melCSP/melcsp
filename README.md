Experience in teamwork was one of the requirements of my last job, where I also used software for account verification and goal achievement. In 2019, I was enrolled in Systems Analysis and Development (SAD) in the Information Technology field. Due to personal reasons, I had to pause the course, but I continued my studies, albeit in another area, until opting for the Information Technology Management course.
